Research and development for the **URC science mission**.

## Goal

The goal is to conduct in-situ analysis with the rover, including life-detection testing of samples to determine the best candidates for a future sample cache. Specifically, the team using the science package onboard the rover should be able to **determine the presence or absence of life, either extinct or extant, at designated sites**. Teams should analyze data relevant to the setting on Earth while demonstrating an understanding of how these observations would translate to a Martian setting.

## Competition Details
- Teams will be given a field briefing by judges and will be tasked with investigating multiple sites of biological interest within a **0.8 km radius** of the start gate. Teams will be given **between 20 and 30 minutes to collect data** with the rover.

- The rover must have a **life detection capability, instrument or assay**, of the team’s choosing. Samples must be investigated by the rover in-situ, and may not be brought back to the crew for investigation. As many as **six sites** may be designated by the judges consisting of **rock or soil**.

- At each site the rover will need to determine the presence or absence of life, extant or extinct. Small amounts of soil may be removed from the sample site for analysis by on-board instrumentation, but rock samples must be evaluated in-situ. **There will be no laboratory analysis – all instruments/tests must be onboard the rover**.

- Teams shall submit a written science plan by May ##, 2019, which will be factored into the judges’ evaluation for the Science Mission. Specifications for the plan will posted to the [URC website] (http://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines/).

- Any chemicals used onboard, including water and any reaction products, must follow a **no-spill policy of being contained on the rover and not spilt on the ground**.  Use of hazardous chemicals must be pre-approved prior to competition by submitting a plan of usage, transportation, safety precautions, and accident plan. Teams should consider that URC takes place in a remote desert location with very limited water supplies and no quick access to emergency medical care. **Hazardous chemicals are strongly discouraged**.

## Presentation

After completion of roving time, teams will have **10 – 15 minutes to prepare a ~10 min presentation for the judges to be given at the field site, based on the onboard analysis**. The presentation and discussion with the judges is allowed even if the team was unsuccessful in collecting data with their rover. The presentation to the judges should include:

  1. The team’s conclusions (**results and explanation of results**) based on the in-situ rover capability for each site regarding the presence or absence of life, distinguishing between extant and extinct life.
  
  2. Results of on-board rover tests performed **including data and images**.
  
  3. Scientific knowledge of **astrobiology and Mars** based on responses to judges’ questions. 
  
## Scoring

The score for this task will be based on the following components:

- Correct identification of extant or extinct life in the designated sample(s).
- Quality and applicability of the onboard analysis and how well this supports the team’s conclusions.
- The completeness, correctness, and clarity of the science plan. 
- Scientific knowledge of astrobiology, particularly as it relates to Mars. 

## Project Plan
