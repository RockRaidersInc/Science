## Notes

- ". . . the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers (GC-MS) **designed to detect evidence of organic compounds in the soil**. After months of operation they had found none at all. The Viking missions were accepted almost unanimously as showing that Mars was a sterile planet, and the **GC-MS data were a crucial part of the evidence**."

- " . . . but some chemists are all but certain that it will find evidence for **organic chemicals close to the martian surface** even though the better equipped Vikings found none."

- "The Viking landers each carried a suite of three experiments **designed to detect micro-organisms in the dust and sand that, along with pumelled rocks, made up the surface at the landing sites**." 

- When watered and fed nutrients, the martian soil gave off gases in ways that had not been expected, some of which might be consistent with biological activity. But the GC-MS data were unequivocal.

- With no evidence for organic molecules in the soil, the results from the life detection experiments were to some extent rendered moot.

> That's the ball game,” said Jerry Soffen, Viking's project scientist, at the time. “No organics on Mars, no life on Mars.”
